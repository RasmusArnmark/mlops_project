# English-French Translation Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on building a machine translation system for English-to-French text using modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We will fine-tune the pre-trained mBART transformer model on the "English-French Translation Dataset" to achieve accurate and efficient translations.

## Dataset
**Name**: [English-French Translation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/en-fr-translation-dataset?resource=download)  
**Description**: A parallel corpus of English and French sentences, curated to ensure quality translations and sufficient data volume for robust model training.  
**Size**: 8.41 GB  

## Objectives
1. Build a robust English-to-French translation system using the mBART transformer model.
2. Fine-tune mBART specifically for this language pair.
3. Implement ML Ops practices for reproducibility, scalability, and efficient deployment.

## Tools and Frameworks
- **Model**: mBART (Hugging Face Transformers).
- **Programming Framework**: PyTorch for model fine-tuning.
- **Data Handling**: Pandas and NumPy for preprocessing.
- **Version Control**: Git and DVC.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Weights & Biases (W&B).
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization.
