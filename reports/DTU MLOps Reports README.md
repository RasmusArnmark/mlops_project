# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

Debugging methods varied among team members, as each approached issues differently. Some preferred to rely on print statements and logging to trace the flow of the code, identifying where unexpected behavior occurred. Others used IDE-integrated debuggers to step through the code and inspect. Additionally, we worked with error messages in a when using different libraries

We also conducted a profiling run using Python's cProfile to analyze the performance of our main code. This revealed bottlenecks a couple of bottlenecks, but we did not spend much time trying to optimise. We generally did not experience any problems with the training or data processing being slow. Obviously this would change if we used a bigger dataset. 

As for the last part, no our code isn't perfect, but we felt we tried to find a balance between usability and performance.

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

Vertex AI: Used for training and experimenting with machine learning models. It provided a scalable and managed environment for running training jobs and tracking experiments, simplifying the model development process.

Google Compute Engine (GCE): We didnt really use it directly but vertex ai uses compute engine, so in a way we did use that as well.

Cloud Run: We deployed our trained models and made an app that served predictions. Cloud Run ensured scalability and low latency without requiring us to manage underlying infrastructure.

Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Used to store and retrieve datasets, preprocessed data, and model artifacts. It acted as a reliable and scalable storage solution for all project assets.

Artifact Registry: Used to store and manage Docker container images. It provided a secure and centralized registry for storing the images used in our Cloud Run deployments.

### Question 18

> **The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs**
> **you used?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the*
> *using a custom container: ...*
>
> Answer:

We used the Compute Engine as the backbone of our GCP workflows, primarily through its integration with other GCP services. For training machine learning models, we leveraged Vertex AI, which runs on Compute Engine instances behind the scenes. This allowed us to focus on model development.

For deployments, we utilized Cloud Run, which also relies on Compute Engine.

We made use of Compute Engine to support our machine learning workflows. For initial experimentation and lighter workloads, we used n1-highmem-2 VMs with 2 vCPUs and 13 GB of RAM. These instances were sufficient for smaller-scale experiments and were configured to run with a containerized training environment hosted in the Artifact Registry. 

Later on we tried using more powerful GPU-enabled instances. Specifically, we experimented with n1-standard-4 VMs equipped with NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs. These instances allowed us to significantly reduce training times by leveraging GPU acceleration.

### Question 19

> **Insert 1-2 images of your GCP bucket, such that we can see what data you have stored in it.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/bucket.png).**
>
> Answer:

![alt text](figures/bucket.png)

Models contains our trained models, and new_data is data from the api, for datadrifting.

### Question 20

> **Upload 1-2 images of your GCP artifact registry, such that we can see the different docker images that you have**
> **stored. You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/registry.png).**
>
> Answer:

![alt text](figures/registry1.png)
![alt text](figures/registry2.png)

We made a couple of repositories, but we used food-class, and had docker images for the training and api. 

### Question 21

> **Upload 1-2 images of your GCP cloud build history, so we can see the history of the images that have been build in**
> **your project. You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/build.png).**
>
> Answer:

We did not use GCP cloud build, but rather built our images with github actions, and then pushed them the the artifact repository. The process is in .github/workflows/cloudbuild*.yaml

### Question 22

> **Did you manage to train your model in the cloud using either the Engine or Vertex AI? If yes, explain how you did**
> **it. If not, describe why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine*
> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we managed to train our model in the cloud using Vertex AI. We chose Vertex AI because it provides a fully managed environment for training machine learning models, allowing us to focus on the training process without worrying about infrastructure management. The specific setup we got tried can be seen in vertex_ai_job.yaml

To train our model, we created a custom Docker container that included all dependencies and our training script. The container image was stored in Artifact Registry and specified in the worker_pool_specs configuration.

Vertex AI is what we felt most comfortable with, and it seemed easy to run multiple expereiments with different setups and engines

## Deployment

### Question 23

> **Did you manage to write an API for your model? If yes, explain how you did it and if you did anything special. If**
> **not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...*
> *to the API to make it more ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we wrote an API for our model using FastAPI and also built a Gradio app for interactive predictions. The FastAPI API handled image uploads, preprocessed them, passed them to the model, and returned predictions. It included robust error handling and ran locally for testing purposes.

For the Gradio app, we deployed it on Cloud Run, allowing users to interact with the model through a simple web interface. The Gradio app was containerized using Docker and served predictions in a user-friendly manner. By working with both FastAPI and Gradio, we provided both API-based and interactive access to the model, ensuring flexibility and scalability. 

The app can be found here: https://food-classification-api-654702382857.europe-west1.run.app

### Question 24

> **Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and**
> **preferably how you invoke your deployed service?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which*
> *worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call*
> *`curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"<weburl>`*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we successfully deployed our API. We wrapped our model into a FastAPI application for local testing and deployed our Gradio app on Cloud Run for cloud-based serving. The FastAPI application was designed to handle image uploads and return predictions and was tested locally for debugging and validation.

For the cloud deployment, we containerized our Gradio app using Docker and pushed the image to Artifact Registry. We then deployed it to Cloud Run, allowing users to access the service via a public URL. The Gradio app provided an intuitive web interface for interacting with the model.

To invoke the deployed service, users could simply open the Gradio web interface or send requests to the FastAPI API during local testing. 

### Question 25

> **Did you perform any unit testing and load testing of your API? If yes, explain how you did it and what results for**
> **the load testing did you get. If not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For unit testing we used ... and for load testing we used ... . The results of the load testing showed that ...*
> *before the service crashed.*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we performed both unit testing and load testing for our API. For unit testing, we used pytest to validate the functionality of individual API endpoints, ensuring proper handling of inputs, outputs, and error cases. These tests were integrated into our CI pipeline and automatically executed using GitHub Actions with every code update, helping us maintain code reliability.

For load testing, we used Locust. We tested the fastapi app by simulating multiple concurrent users making requests. The load testing results showed that the service handled up to 10 concurrent users with minimal latency, but performance degraded beyond that due. We didnt test our cloud run 


### Question 26

> **Did you manage to implement monitoring of your deployed model? If yes, explain how it works. If not, explain how**
> **monitoring would help the longevity of your application.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could*
> *measure ... and ... that would inform us about this ... behaviour of our application.*
>
> Answer:

We implemented prometheus for our gradio app, to monitor metrics like requestcount, we also implemented alerts in Gcloud based on some of those metrics, so we get warnings if the app has a lot of requests. This will help because we know when something might be going wrong with our app, and just to be able to monitor general health. 


## Overall discussion of project

> In the following section we would like you to think about the general structure of your project.

### Question 27

> **How many credits did you end up using during the project and what service was most expensive? In general what do**
> **you think about working in the cloud?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Group member 1 used ..., Group member 2 used ..., in total ... credits was spend during development. The service*
> *costing the most was ... due to ... . Working in the cloud was ...*
>
> Answer:

We used one billing project where s234826 was the owner, and everyone had access. As of friday 24th we used almost 20$, with Compute engine costing 12 of the 20$. And storage being the other main expense. 

Although it took quite a bit of trial and error, we feel comfortable working the cloud now, and getting a new project up and running, would likely be a lot easier. It does complicate the project though. 

### Question 28

> **Did you implement anything extra in your project that is not covered by other questions? Maybe you implemented**
> **a frontend for your API, use extra version control features, a drift detection service, a kubernetes cluster etc.**
> **If yes, explain what you did and why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We implemented a frontend for our API. We did this because we wanted to show the user ... . The frontend was*
> *implemented using ...*
>
> Answer:

We implemented a Gradio app as a frontend for our API. This was done to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the model by uploading images and viewing predictions directly in their browser. The Gradio app made it easier to demonstrate the model’s functionality without requiring users to understand API calls.

### Question 29

> **Include a figure that describes the overall architecture of your system and what services that you make use of.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/overview.png). Additionally, in your own words, explain the**
> **overall steps in figure.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-400 words
>
> Example:
>
> *The starting point of the diagram is our local setup, where we integrated ... and ... and ... into our code.*
> *Whenever we commit code and push to GitHub, it auto triggers ... and ... . From there the diagram shows ...*
>
> Answer:

Our system architecture closely resembles the example figure provided. The process begins locally, where we develop, test, and commit code to our GitHub repository. Once changes are merged into the main branch, GitHub Actions is triggered. The CI/CD pipeline runs unit tests to ensure code quality and then builds Docker images for both the API and the training workflows. These images are pushed to Artifact Registry in GCP for version control and deployment.

From the Artifact Registry, the API Docker image is deployed to Cloud Run, creating a scalable and serverless endpoint for serving model predictions. For training workflows, the training Docker image can be triggered manually, which runs on Vertex AI. This service handles resource provisioning, such as selecting high-memory or GPU-enabled instances, to train models efficiently.

Throughout the process, we use Weights & Biases (W&B) to log experiments, track hyperparameters, and monitor training metrics. Additionally, W&B Sweeps are used for hyperparameter optimization, ensuring we achieve the best possible model performance.

Lastly the end user can interact with the newest model through the gradio app.

>
> Recommended answer length: 200-400 words.
>
> Example:
> *The biggest challenges in the project was using ... tool to do ... . The reason for this was ...*
>
> Answer:

We spent a lot of time on data-drifting and trying to impliment a way to save the pictures submitted by to the api, to compare to the reference data. Anoter big challenge was getting the continueous integration with github actions to work. We could not figure out how to authenticate properly with gcloud, and a lot of our testing hinged on downloading the trained model to test it. 

Another big challenge was getting vertex ai training and deploying the api to work. This was mostly because of our inexperience. 

Lastly, working together on github provided a challenge, as we had to ensure everyone followed the same process for committing and merging branches. 

Some of these issues where related to communication and so we had to communicate to make sure everyone was on the same page. Others we fixed through trail and error, reading logs etc.

> *We have used ChatGPT to help debug our code. Additionally, we used GitHub Copilot to help write some of our code.*
> Answer:

s223750: Focused on developing the API using FastAPI, creating the Gradio app for an interactive frontend, and designing the model architecture. Additionally, worked on abstraction for better modularity and implementing the Cloud Build pipeline for automating Docker image creation.

s234800: Worked on data drifting detection, load testing of the API, and preprocessing the data pipeline. Also led efforts in setting up and running W&B sweeps for hyperparameter optimization and profiling the application to identify and optimize bottlenecks.

s234846: Responsible for training the models in the cloud using Vertex AI, integrating W&B for experiment tracking, and managing data storage in Google Cloud Storage. Also contributed to setting up CI workflows, as well as building and testing Docker containers locally.

Generative AI Usage: We used ChatGPT to debug code, understand error messages, and improve specific parts of our implementation. GitHub Copilot assisted with boilerplate code, such as Dockerfiles, and CI scripts. These tools enhanced efficiency but all work was reviewed and refined by team members to ensure quality and correctness.
