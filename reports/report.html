<h2>Group information</h2>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>75</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s234800, s234846, s223750</p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework</strong>
<strong>did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the third-party framework Gradio in our project. We utilized the Interface class from Gradio to create an interactive web interface for our API. Gradio allowed us to easily set up an interface where users can upload food images and receive predictions in real-time from our model. This framework helped us quickly prototype and deploy a user-friendly front-end for the backend model, significantly reducing the time spent on creating a custom web interface</p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used pip (inside Conda) to manage our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using pipreqs. To get a copy of our exact environment, a new team member would first create a new virtual environment and then install the dependencies through our requirements.txt file. Additionally, they would need to log in to Google Cloud Platform. For Linux, the commands to replicate the environment are as follows:: 
conda create --name myenv --file requirements.txt
conda activate myenv
gcloud auth login
By running these commands, the team member will be able to set up the same environment and access the necessary resources on GCP</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the cookiecutter template provided in the course as the foundation for our project. Almost all the default folders from the template were included, but we made some adjustments to suit our needs. For example, under the tests folder, we created subfolders such as one for test images to keep the directory organized and easy to navigate. Additionally, we removed the notebooks folder, as we are not utilizing Jupyter notebooks in this project </p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,</strong>
<strong>explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These</em>
<em>concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We implemented a rule to structure our scripts in a function-oriented manner. This approach allowed us to easily reuse functions across different parts of the codebase and ensured that updates could be made in one place without needing to modify multiple instances of the same logic. Additionally, we used linting tools to maintain a clean and readable code format, making it easier to collaborate and avoid errors. Comments were also added throughout the code, as we often worked on different parts simultaneously and needed a way to quickly understand what others had implemented.</p>
<p>In larger projects, function-oriented programming is essential for maintaining scalability and avoiding redundancy. Reusable functions reduce duplication and make debugging and updates more efficient. Similarly, comments are critical in large-scale projects to provide context and ensure that even older code remains understandable over time, especially when multiple developers are involved. These practices collectively improve maintainability and team collaboration.</p>
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our</em>
<em>application but also ... .</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In total, we implemented 5 tests. We tested our API to ensure that the model was being loaded correctly and performed a load test to evaluate its robustness. For our data.py script, we tested whether the processed images had the correct dimensions, verified that the appropriate image directories were created, and checked if the data splitting between training, validation, and test sets was accurate. </p>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total code coverage of our project is 23%. While this percentage may seem low, we have focused our testing efforts on the parts of the code that are most likely to cause issues and are critical to the functionality of our application. This ensures that the key components of our system are reliable and meet expectations.</p>
<p>Even if we were to achieve 100% code coverage, it would not guarantee that our code is error-free. Code coverage measures which lines of code are executed during testing, but it does not account for the quality or completeness of the test cases. For example, tests might overlook edge cases, unexpected user inputs, or rare runtime conditions. Additionally, some errors can arise due to external dependencies, integration issues, or environmental factors, which may not be fully captured by the tests.</p>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong>
<strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em>
<em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used branches in our workflow, with each team member working on their own branch to develop and test features independently. This approach kept our work organized and helped avoid conflicts with the main branch. Once a feature or task was completed, we merged the branches directly into the main branch without creating pull requests.</p>
<p>While we didn’t use pull requests, they could have added value to our workflow. Pull requests enable formal code reviews, which can catch bugs, ensure consistency in code style, and maintain a higher level of overall quality. However, we chose not to use pull requests for this project because it was relatively small, and our team had a shared understanding of the purpose and functionality of each script.</p>
<p>For larger projects or teams with less shared context, pull requests would be essential for maintaining code quality, fostering collaboration, and ensuring accountability before merging changes into the main branch.</p>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong>
<strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em>
<em>pipeline</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We initially attempted to use DVC in our project but encountered an issue where the dvc pull command didn’t work as expected when trying to get our data into the training Docker container. Due to time constraints, we decided not to continue using DVC for this project.</p>
<p>In hindsight, DVC could have been highly beneficial, especially for managing and versioning our datasets. For example, it would allow us to track changes to our datasets over time, ensuring that all team members are working with the same data version. This would also make it easier to reproduce experiments and debug issues by referencing specific dataset versions. Additionally, DVC integrates well with Git, which means that changes to the data pipeline could be tied directly to specific code changes, improving overall traceability and collaboration.</p>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,</strong>
<strong>linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free</strong>
<strong>to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing</em>
<em>and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen</em>
<em>here: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have organized our continuous integration into multiple separate workflows to manage different tasks. The first workflow handles linting, running our test scripts, and authenticating with Google Cloud. It ensures that code quality is maintained through tools like flake8 and that all tests are executed properly. Currently, we are testing only on the Ubuntu operating system and using Python version 3.11.</p>
<p>The second workflow is dedicated to building our API Docker image, while the third focuses on building our training Docker image. This separation ensures that each component is built and tested independently, making the process more modular and easier to manage.</p>
<p>At the moment, we are not utilizing caching to optimize build times.</p>
<p>An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <a href="https://github.com/RasmusArnmark/mlops_project/actions/workflows/cloudbuildapi.yaml">https://github.com/RasmusArnmark/mlops_project/actions/workflows/cloudbuildapi.yaml</a></p>
<h2>Running code and tracking experiments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
especially the reproducibility of your experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would</strong>
<strong>run a experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We configured experiments by creating a sweep file to try different values for parameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs. To keep track of the different models trained using the sweep file, we utilized WandB for logging experiment details, monitoring performance, and comparing results. The sweep file allows us to automate and efficiently explore hyperparameter combinations</p>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information</strong>
<strong>is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment</em>
<em>one would have to do ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To ensure the reproducibility of our experiments, we used WandB (Weights and Biases) to log key hyperparameters and model metrics. Each time an experiment is run, we log important values such as the training accuracy, validation accuracy, and loss for each epoch. Additionally, we set all random seeds to a fixed value (e.g., 42) to ensure consistent initialization and randomness across runs. This makes our models reproducible, as the same seed will produce the same results on each run, provided the environment and dependencies remain unchanged. </p>
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&amp;B (or another experiment tracking</strong>
<strong>service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take</strong>
<strong>inspiration from <a href="figures/wandb.png">this figure</a>. Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are</strong>
<strong>important.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.</em>
<em>As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We track several key metrics to assess the performance and progression of our models. Train accuracy provides an indication of how well the model is learning from the training data, showing us if it’s capturing the necessary patterns. Meanwhile, train loss helps us gauge how closely the model’s predictions match the actual values, and monitoring it ensures that the model is improving as expected.</p>
<p>Validation accuracy is important as it measures how well the model performs on new, unseen data, helping us verify that the model is not overfitting. It is the new unseen data we want our model to be good at predicting. Validation loss offers a similar view but in terms of the error made on the validation set, helping us detect potential overfitting. If the validation loss starts to behave differently from the training loss, it could signal that the model is overfitting.</p>
<p>The number of epochs indicates how many times the model has processed the entire dataset, allowing us to understand how long the model has been trained and track its learning journey.</p>
<p>Here is the screen shot: <img src="figures/wandb.png", width = 100%> </p>
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your</strong>
<strong>experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the</em>
<em>training docker image: <code>docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64</code>. Link to docker file: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our project, we developed two Docker images: one for model training and one for serving the API. To run the training Docker image, we use the following command: <code>docker run train:latest --epochs=1 --batch-size=16</code>, But you would not need to specify the parameters, we have set some default parameters. Link to docker file: <a href="https://github.com/RasmusArnmark/mlops_project/blob/main/dockerfiles/train.dockerfile">https://github.com/RasmusArnmark/mlops_project/blob/main/dockerfiles/train.dockerfile</a>.
Using Docker ensures that our training environment is consistent across different systems, eliminating dependency issues. The API image is designed to serve the model, making it easier to deploy. When writing the Dockerfile, we used the cache argument so that if we made a mistake (which we certainly did), we wouldn't have to wait for Docker to reinstall PyTorch each time</p>
<p>By using Docker, we can run our code on various machines without facing compatibility issues. </p>
<h3>Question 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you</strong>
<strong>try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling</em>
<em>run of our main code at some point that showed ...</em></p>
